## 👋 About Me

I'm a Data Scientist with a background in Agronomic Engineering and a strong focus on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and applied statistics. I specialize in identifying patterns in complex datasets, building predictive models, and translating real-world problems into actionable data-driven solutions.

My recent work includes text classification with BERT, regression model optimization, and full-lifecycle data projects—from data cleaning to deployment-ready outputs.
